    <p id="tailgate">Tailgating, within the realm of social engineering, constitutes a specific form of attack. These attacks fall under the category of psychological manipulation, wherein unsuspecting employees are deceived into divulging sensitive information or data. Unlike other cyberattacks that exploit software or technical vulnerabilities, tailgating relies on manipulating humans.
        Here are several methods employed by individuals seeking unauthorized access to high-security areas:
        1. Employee Shadowing Method: This method involves an unauthorized person closely tailing an employee and gaining entry to restricted zones when the employee swipes their access card.
        2. Blend-in or Courier Method: In this approach, an unauthorized individual pretends to be part of a maintenance team or a courier service, blending into the environment to avoid suspicion.
        3. Conversation Tactic: Attackers engage in conversations with authorized personnel, building trust to accompany them. During the interaction, they may request assistance or ask the employee to hold a door open, all while maintaining their cover.
        4. Hands Full Ruse: Perpetrators often carry large boxes and request assistance from employees, who, assuming the attacker can't use their ID card due to their occupied hands, unwittingly open doors for them.
        5. Forgotten ID Deception: An unauthorized person pretends to have left their ID card at home when, in fact, they don't possess one. This tactic relies on the courtesy of unsuspecting employees who grant them access.
        6. Invitation Ploy: Lastly, an attacker may claim that they have been invited by someone specific and provide security personnel with accurate details about that individual. This information can be gathered through discreet reconnaissance.
        Tailgating can also manifest as a scenario where two authorized individuals gain entry to a restricted area. For instance, within an organization, if one person utilizes their access card to enter the area and inadvertently leaves the door open for the second person. In the event of a security breach or data breach occurring within that restricted zone, the authorized person who originally used their access card is often held accountable. This is due to the absence of tangible evidence regarding the presence of the second person in the zone unless security measures such as CCTV cameras were in place.
